Wimble is a multipurpose Joomla template especially for consultancy agencies, a group of experts, interactive agencies or other digital markets, and businesses. This clean, elegant, and well-thought template offers you a collection of pre-made pages, layouts, and content to help boost your business with a beautiful website.

This template comes with 3 homepage variations allowing you to set up a unique website as you need. Wimble is designed creatively and uses a professional color scheme. The template offers quite a bunch of internal layouts (Team, Services, Blog, Case Study, Portfolio, FAQ), and sections that you can mix and match accordingly. All elements are highly flexible, they can be easily adjusted to match your unique requirement.

The Wimble QuickStart pack includes SP Page Builder Pro inside (save $49) so you can create and edit web pages using its front-end drag-and-drop live editing system and powerful addons. Easily add text, images, animations, interactions, and video clips to your pages.

It is built with Helix Ultimate and SP Page Builder Pro. We offer both a raw template, and a QuickStart if you want to start with the demo content, Joomla, and SP Page Builder Pro preinstalled.
