**Avada** is expertly crafted and adheres to all industry standards. The Avada Global Styling Options provides you with a plethora of tools to ensure that your site’s layouts and Elements are rendered pixel-perfect on all mobile devices. The mobile visibility system is a particularly handy set of options that allows you to choose what to display on small, medium, and large screens.

Importing an Avada Prebuilt Website is as simple as clicking a button and is highly flexible. You can choose to import a full demo and parts of any other and anything in between. Choose pages, posts, portfolios, images, sliders, theme options, widgets, or to uninstall as you prefer.

It is that simple. Avada Website Builder gives you the ability to build virtually any design style with the only limits being your imagination. The most advanced Global Styling Options combined with fast visual designing and editing puts everything at your fingertips.

Avada is compatible with many popular plugins; design integration takes compatibility to a much higher level with the likes of The Events Calendar, WooCommerce, bbPress, and Contact Form 7. With these popular plugins, Avada’s Global Styling Options and Element library extend the plugins capability and your ability to adjust to match your website’s branding.

What needs to be compliant is the end-user website, not the software/framework. The Avada WordPress theme as an entity does not violate GDPR criteria because it does not collect any data. With Avada and the necessary privacy tools we provide, you can ensure that your websites are GDPR compliant with all data protection laws.
