Politicas is a Joomla template suitable for political parties, political campaigns, activism, political grassroots movement, or anything related to politics. This template is a complex solution for a local candidate who needs to leave a good online impression, present his program and detailed political vision and promote upcoming events. It's a ready package for the political website, supporting an election campaign with planned events and community meetings. Promote your favorite (male/female) candidate locally and globally.

Politicas comes with 2 homepage variations allowing you to set up a unique political website in accordance with the guidelines. This template has a clean and professional design. It offers quite a bunch of internal layouts and sections that you can mix and match accordingly. All elements are highly flexible, they can be easily adjusted to match your unique requirement.

The Politicas QuickStart pack includes SP Page Builder Pro inside (save $49) so you can create and edit web pages using its front-end drag-and-drop live editing system and powerful addons. Easily add text, images, animations, interactions, and video clips to your pages. It's also fully translation-ready for non-english Joomla websites.

Politicas is built with Helix Ultimate and SP Page Builder Pro. We offer both a raw template, and a QuickStart if you want to start with the demo content, Joomla, and SP Page Builder Pro preinstalled. Add custom content and launch your politically engaged site in one day.
