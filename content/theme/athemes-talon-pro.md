Talon Pro builds on our free theme Talon, adding many new and exciting features that take the customization opportunities to the next level. Talon Pro is perfect for businesses, agencies or freelancers looking for a modern and flexible theme.

With Talon Pro you can add a shortcode to replace the header image. That shortcode can be for anything you want, like a slider or even a video. Also, every page can have its own header. Easily control background or text colors individually for posts/pages. You can even hide the menu, post title or footer if you want. Talon Pro lets you change the footer credits to your own very quickly by visiting the Customizer. If you want, you can also use HTML in the credits field for maximum flexibility. The ability to easily get in touch with you is very important for a business website. That's why Talon Pro lets you add a menu item that shows a contact popup when clicked.
