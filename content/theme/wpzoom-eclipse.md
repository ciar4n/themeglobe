Use Eclipse to enhance your work through a simple, yet very functional website design. Perfect fit for photographers and bloggers who want to make a great impact with a minimalist look.

Eclipse features a fluid, responsive layout, so your pages will display perfectly across mobile and tablet devices. Images and galleries scale seamlessly when resizing the browser window. Every detail of your website will look perfect and professional, regardless of what resolution or screen size visitors have.

If youâ€™re a photographer, then the includedGallerytemplate andPortfolio posts, will come in handy as they allow you to keep your work separate from blog posts. In this way you can run a separate blog on your site and also have a beautiful gallery page that includes your work.
