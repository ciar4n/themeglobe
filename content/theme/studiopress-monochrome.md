Want a website that’s substantial but simple? Come see the sleek difference that white space and typography make in minimal design with Monochrome Pro. If having a visually strong digital presence and an easy-to-use site are equally important to you, then Monochrome Pro is the Genesis-powered theme you’ve been waiting for.

This dynamic Open Source theme supports automatic set up and import of the sample demo content and recommended plugins. Choose one of the included Starter Packs and click the “Install Pack” button after theme activation to get started. None of your existing content will be lost.

The Atomic Blocks plugin will be automatically installed and activated with this theme along with Genesis eNews Extended, Simple Social Icons, and WPForms Lite.
