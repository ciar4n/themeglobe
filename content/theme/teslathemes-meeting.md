Meeting is a One-page Event WordPress theme for events, conferences, workshops, summits, meetups etc. It’s the perfect combination of a beautiful and modern design with tons of powerful features and a professionally written code base.

Meeting is ultra responsive and looks perfectly in all screens and you don’t need to be a programmer to set up and run an event page. This lets you focus on the most important thing, creating beautiful content and interact with your attendees!

It includes more than 40+ different content elements with advanced styling options that can be easily created and managed from your frontend or backend. It gives you practically unlimited possibilities to organize your site (your imagination is the limit).
