This Newspaper Joomla template comes with 3 pre-designed home layouts so you don’t need to worry about designing your home page. All pages are quick to setup and easy to customize.

The Gazette template QuickStart pack comes with SP Page Builder Pro 3, so you can construct your own webpages using the page builder’s front-end drag-and-drop live editing system.

Gazette is developed on JoomShaper’s Helix Ultimate framework. It utilizes the latest Bootstrap 4 library, fully-responsive & mobile optimized with additional features to control device-specific responsiveness, and major browser compatibility.
