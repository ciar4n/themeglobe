The new role of website design is to tell a story, which is what Parallax Pro was developed to do. Parallax keeps your page content in proper narrative order, giving you a simple vertical design for easy visual eye movement and flow. It divides your content into parts, with a clear connection between them. This allows your visitors to read it like a real story, with no pause or break, and leads them right to your call to action.

This dynamic Open Source theme supports automatic set up and import of the sample demo content and recommended plugins. Choose one of the included Starter Packs and click the “Install Pack” button after theme activation to get started. None of your existing content will be lost.

Building for the first time? Gutenberg enables developers and designers to create reusable modules for design and content. Our Advanced Gutenberg Themes are built from the base up with blocks. Empower end-users to customize those modules—or combine with others—enabling you to do everything from launching twenty simple landing pages in an hour to building a complex new digital experience.
