**Stacks** – X includes multiple unique designs inside of one powerful WordPress theme, and we refer to these designs as “Stacks.” There are currently four Stacks available in X. It’s like buying one theme and constantly getting access to new designs all the time! We have created multiple unique demos so be sure to check them all out.

**Extensions** – Easily build upon the firm foundation X has already provided with an incredible lineup of additional plugins. Within the X ecosystem, Extensions are comprised of plugins built by our staff to work seamlessly with X, as well as third party plugins by developers we’ve partnered with to bring you great features that we’ve integrated tightly into the theme. This keeps X lean for those who might not need a certain feature and as efficient as possible for those who do! Be sure to check out a full list of our Extensions for more information on these amazing features that are included for free with each unique purchase as well as this FAQ explaining how the licensing works.

**Experts** – X was built upon the input of industry-leading experts. We consulted numerous individuals and asked them what sort of features they wanted to see in a theme from an SEO standpoint, design, feature-set, et cetera, and built their suggestions right into the theme. Forget the marketing speak, X truly delivers on what it promises.

**Theme Options Panel** – Being on the cutting edge of WordPress development is something we wanted to do from the start. Because of that, we made sure that we avoided the use of clunky additional admin panels and instead, opted to utilize a powerful, recently rebuilt theme options panel. With this setup, you can preview all of the changes you make to your site live without any need to switch windows or refresh the browser in addition to searching for exactly what you need. When you’re happy with your changes, select “Save” and your updates will go live.
