Sydney Pro takes the power ofour free Sydney themeand supercharges it â€“ enabling both freelancers and businesses to create a fantastic looking website quickly and easily.

### Your Choice of Header

With Sydney Pro you can use a shortcode (for a slider plugin) in your header, or simply take advantage of the built-in integration for Crelly Slider. Either way, you can quickly add a slider and impress your visitors.

### Single Post/Page Options

A new set of options is added to the single post and page interface. Easily change the background image or color, hide the post/page title or change the content wrapper opacity. All of this individually for any post or page you want.

### Extra Page Templates

We now have a total of seven page templates. Five extra pages templates were added to Sydney Pro for a higher level of flexibility. Here are the page templates that we've added: contact, featured header - default, featured header - wide, no header - default, no header - wide.
