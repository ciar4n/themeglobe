Put yourself on the front lines of online publishing with the up-to-the-minute, high-gloss look and feel of the Magazine theme. Your online features never looked better than with the versatile layouts and media-ready design of the Magazine theme. A stylish frame speaks volumes about the publisher.

This dynamic Open Source theme supports automatic set up and import of the sample demo content and recommended plugins. Choose one of the included Starter Packs and click the “Install Pack” button after theme activation to get started. None of your existing content will be lost.

Building for the first time? Gutenberg enables developers and designers to create reusable modules for design and content. Our Advanced Gutenberg Themes are built from the base up with blocks. Empower end-users to customize those modules—or combine with others—enabling you to do everything from launching twenty simple landing pages in an hour to building a complex new digital experience.
