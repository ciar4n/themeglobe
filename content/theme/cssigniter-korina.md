Korina is an easy to configure WordPress theme for bars, restaurants & caf√©s. Reflect your business's mission through an elegant and modern website built with Korina.

Specify the layout, adjust the colors, set your main menu as "sticky" and more. No need to mess with complicated software just to get an amazingly beautiful but truly usable header.

We think the current font selection is awesome but you are in control. Multiple typography options lets you set the perfect mood for your site and get it aligned with your overall branding strategy.

Korina is compatible with the brand new block editor. Shortcodes are provided for those of you not really into it yet. Last but not least Korina provides seamless integration with Beaver builder, Elementor or Divi for those who love building things visually.
