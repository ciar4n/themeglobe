Manufacturer is a multipurpose Joomla template designed for manufacturing, industrial, engineering, and related businesses. It can be used by anyone who operates and manages electrical and electronic devices, automotive parts, industrial equipment and machinery, garments & textile, and any business in a similar line.

This template comes with 4 homepage variations allowing you to set up a unique website as you need. Manufacturer is creatively designed with a professional color scheme and offers quite a bunch of internal layouts (Services, Products, About Us, Blog, Case Study, Contact, etc.). All elements are highly flexible, they can be easily adjusted to highlight your business strengths.

The Manufacturer QuickStart pack includes SP Page Builder Pro inside (save $49) so you can create and edit web pages using its front-end drag-and-drop live editing system and powerful addons. Easily add text, images, animations, interactions, and video clips to your pages.

It is built with Helix Ultimate and SP Page Builder Pro. We offer both a raw template, and a QuickStart if you want to start with the demo content, Joomla, and SP Page Builder Pro preinstalled.
