Infinite is a WordPress theme, from Themify, that allows readers to view an infinite number of posts when scrolling down the page. It helps readers better engage with your site as the content continues to load endlessly. This technique is widely seen in many popular editorial sites such as Vogue, Forbe, Mashable, DigitalTrends, 9to5mac, and many more. With the drag & drop Builder, you can design beautiful and unique article layouts (see sample post) that integrates infinite scrolling. It also comes with many other features such as sticky header, banner ad spots, slide-out widgets, and WooCommerce, which makes it an even more powerful theme with a beautiful and minimal design.
