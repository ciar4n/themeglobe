Fortune is a purpose-oriented Joomla template especially aimed at care facilities for seniors, nursing homes, old-age homes, charity, and any social initiatives for the elderly. This clean, elegant, and well-thought template offers you a collection of pre-made pages, layouts, and content to create the best senior care website.

This template comes with 2 homepage variations allowing you to set up a unique website as you need. Fortune was designed creatively and uses a nice color scheme. The template offers quite a bunch of internal layouts (Fundraising Campaigns, Memory Wall, Services, Events, Pricing, Gallery), and sections that you can mix and match accordingly.

The Fortune QuickStart pack includes SP Page Builder Pro inside (save $49) so you can create and edit web pages using its front-end drag-and-drop live editing system and powerful addons. Easily add text, images, animations, interactions, and video clips to your pages.

Fortune is built with Helix Ultimate and SP Page Builder Pro. We offer a raw template and QuickStart if you want to start with the demo content, Joomla, and SP Page Builder Pro preinstalled.
