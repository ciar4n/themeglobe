Split is a fully responsive WordPress theme that's built with a split scrolling feature allowing you to create a cool splitting effect as you scroll from one row to the next. We've built this feature to allow you to display any content (fullwidth video, image, text) on any row of your site using this visually appealing effect. We've also included a pair of post layouts, no sidebar (half page), and sidebar (fullwidth feature image). These layouts allow you to change the way you display your portfolio or blog pages. In addition to this, we've packed this theme with 9 differently colored skins, 8 sample page layouts, header and footer visibility options, infinite scroll, and a masonry layout. Visit the demo to see what you can build with Split!

The Split Scrolling feature is a flexible way of creating a nifty split-screen effect as you scroll through your content, allowing you to display any content on any row on your site, in a very visually appealing way. Whether you're showcasing a background image, an image slider, or even a video, the split scrolling feature works flawlessly. On tablet devices, the split scrolling will have full section scrolling effect. We've built some sample page layouts that showcases how you can use this feature on your site.
