Utafiti is a clean and elegant design aimed at medical professionals or just those looking for an ultra polished and modern website. Itâ€™s built on the Zen Grid Framework v5 which ensures super fast page speed together with huge flexibility and functionality.

Utafiti makes extensive use of the Zentools2 module throughout the template with several stylised examples, the front page includes the Hero slideshow alongside other slideshows and grid based Zentools2 modules.

Alongside the Zentools2 modules are template features such as Google fonts, Fontawesome icons, Google maps and social media icons/links. Not forgetting the great built in features of Buildr including different menu options, 40+ module positions, many different layouts, numerous styling and animation options, module styles by the dozen plus Bootstrap support and much more.
