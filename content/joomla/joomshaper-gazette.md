The Gazette template lets you monetize your website with ease, using advertisements in multiple areas, also in the menu.

This Newspaper Joomla template comes with 3 pre-designed home layouts so you don’t need to worry about designing your home page. All pages are quick to setup and easy to customize. You can effortlessly change the basic things like texts, images, background, icons, layouts, colors, and fonts to enhance your site’s visual appeal. The Gazette template QuickStart pack comes with SP Page Builder Pro 3, so you can construct your own webpages using the page builder’s front-end drag-and-drop live editing system.

Gazette is developed on JoomShaper’s Helix Ultimate framework. It utilizes the latest Bootstrap 4 library, fully-responsive & mobile optimized with additional features to control device-specific responsiveness, and major browser compatibility. No coding skills necessary. No matter the challenge, from a modern magazine style design to a classic news portal, Gazette is well worth using.
