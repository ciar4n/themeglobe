Opus comes with pre-built designs for businesses, consulting firms, and creative agencies. However, as this is a flexible, multipurpose Joomla template, you can quickly and easily match it to other niches like private, public and social sector entities.

The template offers 3 high-quality homepage layouts. The pages are quick to setup and easy to customize. You can effortlessly change basic things like texts, images, background, icons, layouts, colors, and fonts to enhance your site’s visual appeal. The Opus template QuickStart pack comes with SP Page Builder Pro 3, so you can construct your own webpages using the page builder’s front-end drag-and-drop live editing system.

Opus is developed on JoomShaper’s Helix Ultimate framework. It utilizes the latest Bootstrap 4 library, fully-responsive & mobile optimized with additional features to control device-specific responsiveness, and major browser compatibility. No coding skills necessary. No matter the challenge, type of business website you planned, Opus is well worth using.
